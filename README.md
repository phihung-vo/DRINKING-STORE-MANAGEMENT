- In the project, we divide people into 2 level: store's manager (admin) and staff (user)
- All rules in project are the following:
    + Manage drinkings, staff, selling, tables, table booking, add managers (if big store needs more than 1 manager).
    + Analyzing revenue each month, showing logs of product's changings, logs of staff's logins and logouts.
    + If the first login of a new day, we reset all tables into empty status, meaning no table is used at the first login of new day.
    + From the 2nd login in the same day, all of tables which are in used won't be reset so that the staff can check num of tables which are empty.
    + Logout, exit the program.   
    + On database: encrypt password on database with MD5 encryption; use of Store Procedure, Function on DB.
- Admin has all rights including modifying all information, user is only able to: manage table booking, do the selling, watch all the information of product, logout.

- Admin's account: username: admin ; password: admin
- One of user's accounts: username: fffff ; password: fffff
